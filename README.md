{% set expandedResults = craft.expandedSearch.search(query) %}
{% set expandedResults = craft.expandedSearch.search(query, { sections: ['news'], length: 150 }) %}
{% for result in expandedResults %}
    <strong data-field="{{result.matchedField}}">{{result.entry.title}}</strong><br>
    <p>{{result.matchedValue}}</p>
    <a href="{{result.entry.url}}">{{result.entry.url}}</a>
{% else %}
    <p>Sorry, no results for {{query}}.</p>
{% endfor %}
```

## Expanded Search from Element API

To use the plugin from ElementAPI. Do a normal search and then for each result, you can fetch the `ExpandedSearchModel` from the service.

```
'transformer' => function(Entry $entry) {
    $searchResults = ExpandedSearch::$plugin->expandedSearchService->expandSearchResults($entry, $query, $length);
    return [
        'id' => $entry->title,
        'title' => $entry->title,
        'matchedValue' => $searchResult->matchedValue,
        'matchedField' => $searchResult->matchedField
    ];
},
```

## Expanded Search Roadmap

Some things to do, and ideas for potential features:

-   [x] ~~Release it~~
-   [x] ~~Add proper pagination within the plugin~~
-   [ ] Add handling for more fields
